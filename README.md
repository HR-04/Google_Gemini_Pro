### Gemini API: Testing Gemini-pro and Gemini-pro-vision 

It demonstrates how to use the Python SDK for the Gemini API, which gives you access to Google's Gemini large language models. It demonstrate to
1. Set up your development environment and API access to use Gemini.
2. Generate text responses from text inputs.
5. Use embeddings for large language models.
3. Generate text responses from multimodal inputs (text and images).


### Prerequisites

To run this locally, ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

-  Python 3.9+
-  Has Google cloud credentials and Generative AI API enabled in your Google cloud account.
-  An installation of `jupyter` to run the notebook.

You can run this quickstart in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/generative-ai-docs/blob/main/site/en/tutorials/python_quickstart.ipynb), which runs this notebook directly in the browser and does not require additional environment configuration.
